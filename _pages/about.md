I'm an incoming PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
Mellon University. My graduate studies are supported by the Department of Energy
Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF). 

My research interests lie in compilers, code analyses and
transformations, operating systems, computer architecture, and 
new technologies at the intersection of different layers of the
computer systems stack.

I graduated from Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree 
in computer science, where I focused my studies on computer systems. 
During my time at NU, I worked as an undergraduate researcher and 
teaching assistant in the Department of Computer Science. I was 
advised by Professors [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) and 
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/), and 
I was an active member of [NU Compilers Group](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html#Collaboration),
[NUâ€™s Prescience Lab](http://www.presciencelab.org/), and the NU Parallelism 
Group.

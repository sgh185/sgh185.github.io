I'm a 4th year undergraduate pursuing a bachelor’s degree in CS at 
Northwestern University. At my time at NU, I've primarily focused my 
studies on computer systems. Additionally, I've worked as an undergraduate
researcher and peer mentor at the NU Department of Computer Science. 

My research interests lie in compilers, operating systems, and new 
technologies at the intersection of different layers of the computer 
systems stack --- "blending". 

As an undergraduate researcher, I've made contributions to long-term 
research projects at Northwestern such as the [Interweaving Project](http://interweaving.org/)
and the [Nautilus Aerokernel](https://hale-legacy.com/nautilus/). I'm 
is also an active member of several research groups including the [NU 
Compilers Group](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html#Collaboration),
[NU’s Prescience Lab](http://www.presciencelab.org/), the NU Parallelism 
Group, and the NU TimeSqueezing Group. 

I plan to pursue a PhD in computer science after graduation.

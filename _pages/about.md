I'm an undergraduate pursuing a bachelor’s degree in CS at 
Northwestern University. During my time at NU, I've primarily focused my 
studies on computer systems, and I've worked as an undergraduate
researcher and teaching assistant at NU's Department of Computer Science. 

My research interests lie in compilers, code analyses and
transformations, operating systems, computer architecture, and 
new technologies at the intersection of different layers of the
computer systems stack --- "blending" --- that can improve 
performance and efficiency in new ways. 

I have made contributions to long-term research projects such as 
the [Interweaving Project](http://interweaving.org/) and the 
[Nautilus Aerokernel](https://hale-legacy.com/nautilus/). I'm 
also an active member of several research groups including the [NU 
Compilers Group](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html#Collaboration),
[NU’s Prescience Lab](http://www.presciencelab.org/), the NU Parallelism 
Group, and the NU TimeSqueezing Group. I currently work closely
with Professors [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) and 
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/) on
research directions involving middle-end compiler optimizations
and operating systems.

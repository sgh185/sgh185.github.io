I'm a fourth-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
Mellon University advised by [Brandon Lucia](https://brandonlucia.com/)
and [Nathan Beckmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~beckmann/).
I'm a member of the
[abstract](http://abstract.ece.cmu.edu/) and [CORGi](https://cmu-corgi.github.io/) 
research groups. My PhD is supported by the Department of Energy 
Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF). 

I'm interested in **post-von Neumann computer architectures**.
My research focuses on general-purpose *spatial dataflow architectures*
and the programming languages and compilers that target them.
I've previously worked on the hardware-software stack for 
highly energy-efficient coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays.

I received my bachelor's degree in computer science from Northwestern
University in 2021 where I was advised by [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) and 
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/).

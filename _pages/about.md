I'm a second-year PhD student in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie
Mellon University. I am advised by [Brandon Lucia](https://brandonlucia.com/)
and [Nathan Beckmann](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~beckmann/) and a member of the
[abstract](http://abstract.ece.cmu.edu/) and[CORGi](https://cmu-corgi.github.io/) 
research groups. My graduate studies are supported by the Department of Energy 
Computational Science Graduate Fellowship (DOE CSGF). 

My research interests lie in compilers, computer architecture, 
reconfigurable computing, and cross-stack systems design.
I'm currently working on programming models and compilation support 
for energy-minimal coarse-grained reconfigurable arrays (CGRAs). 

I graduated from Northwestern University with a bachelor's degree 
in computer science, where I focused on computer systems. 
I was advised by [Peter Dinda](http://pdinda.org/) and 
[Simone Campanoni](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/) and 
was an active member of [NU Compilers Group](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~simonec/Team.html#Collaboration),
[NUâ€™s Prescience Lab](http://www.presciencelab.org/), and the NU Parallelism Group.

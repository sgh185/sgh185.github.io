## "Blended Systems" --- the Interweaving Project
The numerous pieces of a computer systems stack (the compiler, the OS, the 
architecture, etc.) are usually considered as separate entities. What if 
these entities weren't strictly separated --- what if these pieces were
"interwoven" or "blended"? I'm interested in exploring the feasibility, 
efficiency, and the performance of these systems --- especially at the 
intersection of the compiler and operating system layers. 

The following are projects in this research direction that I've contributed to:

- **Compiler-Timing**

  **In collaboration with:** Prescience Lab, NU Compilers Group, Illinois Institute 
  of Technology, Carnegie Melon, NU Parallel Architecture Group

- Floating-Point Spy (**FPSpy**), Floating-Point Virtual Machine (**FPVM**)

  **In collaboration with:** Prescience Lab 

- Compiler and Runtime-Based Address Translation (**CARAT**)

  **In collaboration with:** Prescience Lab, NU Compilers Group, NU Parallel Architecture Group


## Next Generation Compilers 
I'm interested in investigating and developing novel compiler optimization
and code generation techniques for the next generation of compilers. 

The following are projects in this research direction that I've contributed to:
 
- **Noelle**

  **In collaboration with:** NU Compilers Group 

- **TimeSqueezer**

  **In collaboration with:** NU Compilers Group, NU TimeSqueezing Group
